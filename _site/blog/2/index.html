					<h3>Last Worship Service of the Quarter</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Sunday Dec 08, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>Our last worship service before the end of the quarter! We enjoyed singing: ‚ÄúI will enter his gates with thanksgiving‚Äù and ‚ÄúChrist has come to be life‚Äù. We also learned about God‚Äôs economy, which is His process and arrangement to reach man, in order to fulfill His purpose. 
Aftewards, we enjoyed a potluck tomorrow. One of the families even made seafood gumbo! Delicious!</p>

						<p>Our last Bible study of the quarter! We enjoyed reading Matthew Chapters 8 and 9. At the end, we decided to start a bible-reading challenge over winter quarter to read 1 chapter of Matthew a week. Let‚Äôs keep reading His word!</p>

					<h3>Worship Service</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Sunday Nov 17, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>We really enjoyed during this worship service that we can spend time with Jesus. We sang two songs: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hymnstream/when-thou-wakest-in-the-morning">‚ÄúWhen thou wakest in the morning‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/william-jeng/take-time-to-behold-him">‚ÄúTake time to behold Him‚Äù</a>. In the speaking, we learned that we can spend time with Jesus alone. It is good to take a few minutes each day to spend time with Jesus. Here are some things we can do during our time with the Lord:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Calling</b> ‚Äì Calling on the Name of the Lord to set our mind on the spirit ‚Äì 1 Cor.12:3; Rom. 8:6; 10:12-13 (1/2 Minute)</li>
  <li><b>Praying</b> ‚Äì Opening our heart, softening our heart and emptying ourselves. Telling Him that we love Him ‚Äì 2 Cor. 3:16; Psa. 62:8 (1 Minute)</li>
  <li><b>Pray-reading</b> ‚Äì Using our exercised spirit to pray over a verse or two. Turning the verses into a personal prayer ‚Äì Eph. 6:17-18; 2 Tim. 3:16 (2 1/2 Minutes)</li>
  <li><b>Confession</b> ‚Äì Confessing the sins and offenses on our conscience and removing all blockages to fellowship. Asking for forgiveness and cleansing ‚Äì 1 John 1:7, 9; Psa. 66:18; Isa. 59:1-2 (1 Minute)</li>
  <li><b>Consecration</b> ‚Äì Presenting ourselves to the Lord afresh, giving Him the full ground in us ‚Äì Rom. 12:1-2; 6:13,19; Mark 12:30 (1/2 Minute)</li>
  <li><b>Thanksgiving</b> ‚Äì Giving thanks for all things; for all the persons, situations and things in your life and praising Him ‚Äì Eph. 5:20; 1 Thes. 5:18 (1/2 Minute)</li>
  <li><b>Petition</b> ‚Äì Asking the Lord for needs, growth and persons that need salvation ‚Äì 1 Tim. 2:1: Eph. 6:18; Matt. 7:7; Psa. 143:8 (1 Minute)</li>
</ol>

					<h3>Pre-Thanksgiving Dinner</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Sunday Nov 17, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>We had a delicious thanksgiving dinner with students and families in the Palo Alto area. We‚Äôre so thankful to all the families and who helped prepared the meal for us. During the time, we also had some sharings concerning what we were thanksful for. The Lord has done so much for us this school year. Thank you Lord!</p>

<p>Afterwards, we played games and had a fun evening together.</p>

					<h3>Thursday Night Bible Study</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Thursday Nov 14, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>Yeeeep, just some crazy lovers of Jesus üôå. So glad to be together and to read the word of God! We covered Matthew Chapter 7 and saw how we need to be careful in our labor for the Lord. We don‚Äôt want to be worker‚Äôs of lawlessness mentioned in verse 23. This chaptered showed that we can do many things for the Lord, yet the Lord may not approve them because he was not the initiator of these works. May we be like the prudent man in verse 24 who hears the word of the Lord and does them.</p>

					<h3>Worship Service</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Sunday Oct 27, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>During today‚Äôs worship service, we learned that as believers, we need to flock together. The Lord considers us as His sheep and as His sheep, we need to flock together. John 10:16 says that there shall be one flock and one shepherd. An isolated sheep is easy prey to the enemy. Therefore we need to come together to encourage one another. This is our protection from the enemy. Hebrews 10:25 says: ‚ÄúNot abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near‚Äù.</p>

					<h3>Intercollegiate Fall Retreat</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Saturday Oct 26, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>We had a wonderful weekend at the intercollegiate fall retreat! We joined several other universities in the bay area for a saturday full of singing, blending, and receiving at UC Davis! We heard a fresh speaking concerning God‚Äôs heart of love for man! The Bible reveals God as reaching man and that God desires to share His life with man.</p>

					<h3>Thursday Night Bible Study</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Thursday Oct 24, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>As Christians how can we overcome temptations? We saw in Matthew chapter 4 in this week‚Äôs bible study that the LOrd overcame each of the Devil‚Äôs temptation by the word of God. According to Ephesians chapter 6, verse 16-17, the word of God is the sword of the Spirit which we use to slay the enemy. Thus, we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayers - meaning that we pray over the word of God. Hallelujah for the word of God! At the end, we enjoyed this song: Seek ye first the kingdom of God.</p>

					<h3>Tuesday Lunch Bible Study</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Tuesday Oct 08, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>Did you know that Christ can be our living star? The Magi in Matthew chatper 2 saw the Lord‚Äôs star rising and went to find Jesus. Their attitude is in contrast to the jews in Jerusalem. The jews knew the prophecy of where CHrist was to be born, yet had no desire to go to Bethlem to see Jesus. Many times, we may read the word of God, yet we do not come to Jesus. May we be those who both know the scriptures and come to Jesus. We also enjoyed this verse 2 Pet 1:19. Here is a video of us singing it at another bible study:</p>

					<h3>Thursday Night Bible Study</h3>
					<hr>

						<p>This was our first Thursday night Bible Study of the year. This week, we started with Matthew Ch. 1. How do you know Jesus? Matthew 1 introduces us to Him in a couple of ways: first, He is a king of a long royal line. However, He is also a man‚Äîhuman like us! Let‚Äôs all strive to know Jesus as both man and king!</p>

					<h3>First Worship Service</h3>
					<hr>
			    	<h5 class="date">Sunday Sep 29, 2019</h5>
					
						<p>First worship service of the quarter on campus! üôå This morning, our topic was on ‚Äúanxiety.‚Äù Are you anxious? Worried about your future? 1 Peter 5:7 says, ‚ÄúCasting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.‚Äù Philippians 4:6-7 also tells us to ‚ÄúLet your requests be made known to God and the peace of God‚Ä¶will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.‚Äù Let‚Äôs practice casting our anxiety on the Lord this week, to remain in fellowship with Him, talking with Him and letting our requests be made known to God. May we keep learning to trust in the One who empowers us to do all things (Phil 4:13). Check us out next Sunday! #wehaveGodaspeace #gatheredinThyname #ihaverootsbytheriver</p>
